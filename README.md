# Hot-plate-behavior-
These scripts allow you to create a color-coded raster plot of different behaviors, and restructure your data from the original timestamp scoring to analyze the behaviors in aggregate or individually, and to examine their cumulative displays. There is a .csv sample file included for the 3 scripts, but for your own use you will have to change the behavior names to the things you scored for. Please see Figure 5(A-D) and Supplement 10 and 11 of http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v23/n2/full/nm.4262.html to see how this type of data looks in its final form.
